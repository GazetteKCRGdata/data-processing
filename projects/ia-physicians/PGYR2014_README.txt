1.  Important Note on the Program Year 2014 Data Files

This data set is the initial publication of the 2014 program year data that was matched with total confidence to a particular covered recipient (i.e., physician, teaching hospital, or principal investigator) and displays information about that recipient. 

The data contained in the CSV files does not include all of the data submitted to Open Payments for program year 2014. Consult the Open Payments Data Dictionary and Methodology document for an explanation of the criteria that the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) used to determine what data to publish. This document can be found on the Resources page of the Open Payments website (http://www.cms.gov/OpenPayments/About/Resources.html). The Data Dictionary and Methodology document also includes information about the data collection and reporting methodology, data fields included in the files, and any notes or special considerations that users should be aware of.

2. Important Considerations for using the CSV Files

Microsoft Excel removes leading zeros from data fields in the CSV files. Certain fields in these data sets may have leading zeros. These zeroes will be missing when viewing the information within Microsoft Excel. 

Additionally, the latest versions of Microsoft Excel cannot display data sets with more than 1,048,576 rows. Some of these CSV files may exceed that limit. Displaying the data in its entirety may require the use of spreadsheet programs capable of handling very large numbers of records.
